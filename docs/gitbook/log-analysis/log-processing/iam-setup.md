- `S3 Buckets`: Required. The names of the S3 buckets that contain the logs

When you click the **Launch Stack** button, a new tab will open in your browser and take you to the AWS Console. Make sure you sign in the AWS Account that was provided in the step above.

Check the acknowledgement in the Capabilities box in the Create stack page
{% endhint %}

Click the **Create stack** button. After few seconds, the stack's `Status` should change to `CREATE_COMPLETE`. If there is an error creating the stack, then an IAM role with the same name may already exist in your account.

Get back to Panther browser tab and click on **Next,** then **Add New Source** to complete the setup.

{% hint style="success" %}
Congratulations! You have granted Panther the permissions to process your logs in S3.
{% endhint %}

The next sections we will detail how to configure SNS notifications so Panther can analyze new logs as they are delivered to S3.
