# Development

## Environment

You can use the Docker environment from the [quick start](quick-start.md#deployment) instructions for development as well! However, it's faster to compile and test the code if you install the development tools locally.

### Manual Installation

Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install#install) 1.13+, [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 10+, and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.7+. For MacOS w/ homebrew, this is easy: `brew install go node python3`

Add go tools to your environment: `export GOPATH=$HOME/go PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin`

Install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv1.html), which usually works best with the [bundled installer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-bundle.html):

```bash
curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip" -o "awscli-bundle.zip"
unzip awscli-bundle.zip
sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws
```

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and make sure the daemon is running in the background.

Install [Mage](https://magefile.org/#installation): `go get github.com/magefile/mage`

Finally, install the remaining development libraries with `mage setup && npm i`

## Mage

Panther uses [mage](https://magefile.org/), a Go tool similar to `make` , to manage the development lifecycle.

Run `mage` from the repo root to see the list of available commands:

```text
Targets:
  build:api           Generate Go client/models from Swagger specs in api/
  build:lambda        Compile all Lambda function source
  clean               Remove auto-generated build artifacts
  deploy              Deploy application infrastructure
  fmt                 Format source files
  setup               Install development dependencies
  test:ci             Run all required checks
  test:cover          Run Go unit tests and view test coverage in HTML
  test:integration    Run TestIntegration* for PKG (default: ./...)
  test:lint           Check code style
  test:unit           Run unit tests
```

You can easily chain `mage` commands together, for example: `mage fmt test:ci deploy`

## Testing

1. Run backend test suite: `mage test:ci`
2. Run frontend test suite: `npm run lint`
3. Run integration tests against a live deployment: `mage test:integration`
   - **WARNING**: integration tests will erase all Panther data stores
   - To run tests for only one package: `PKG=./internal/compliance/compliance-api/main mage test:integration`

## Updating

To update your deployment of Panther, follow the steps below:

1. Checkout the latest release:
   1. `git fetch origin master`
   2. `git checkout tags/v0.1.1`
2. Clean the existing build artifacts: `mage clean`
3. Deploy the latest application changes: `mage deploy`

## Repo Layout

Since the majority of Panther is written in Go, the repo follows the standard [Go project layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout):

- [**api**](https://github.com/panther-labs/panther/tree/master/api)**:** input/output models for communicating with Panther's backend APIs
- [**deployments**](https://github.com/panther-labs/panther/tree/master/deployments)**:** CloudFormation templates for deploying Panther itself or integrating the accounts you want to scan
- [**docs**](https://github.com/panther-labs/panther/tree/master/docs)**:** License headers, README images, code of conduct, etc
- [**internal**](https://github.com/panther-labs/panther/tree/master/internal)**:** Source code for all of Panther's Lambda functions
- [**pkg**](https://github.com/panther-labs/panther/tree/master/pkg)**:** Standalone Go libraries that could be directly imported by other projects
  - This folder is [licensed](https://github.com/panther-labs/panther/blob/master/LICENSE) under Apache v2
- [**tools**](https://github.com/panther-labs/panther/tree/master/tools)**:** Magefile source and other build infrastructure
- [**web**](https://github.com/panther-labs/panther/tree/master/web)**:** Source for the Panther web application
