| Risk     | Remediation Effort |
| :------- | :----------------- |
| **High** | **Medium**         |

This policy validates that all Redshift Clusters have encryption enabled. Encryption of data at rest is a critical and simple step to ensure the protection of sensitive data in case of a database breach.
