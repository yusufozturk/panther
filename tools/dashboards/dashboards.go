/*
Dashboards are generated rather than explicitly defined
as json/yml text files because a dashboard is define as a JSON
string property in a resource. If we were to declare this in text file, the developer
would have to properly JSON escape the string AND do a Fn::Sub to
insert the region in the JSON at various places. This is tedious
and error prone. Generating the CF files is much simpler for the
developer and easier to read.

The methodology for adding dashboards is to:
1. Design in the AWS CloutWatch Console
2. Use the "View/edit source" option to copy the JSON for the dashboard
3. Create a new file holding a global var bound to the JSON
4. Add a line to Dashboards() below instantiating the CF dashboard resource
