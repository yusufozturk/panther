## Use Cases

Panther works by analyzing security-relevant data generated by your clouds, networks, applications, and hosts to enable threat detection, cloud security, and investigations.

Panther provides flexible Python detection logic, secure and automated deployments within your AWS cloud, and support for popular security logs, commonly used for:

- **Detecting Malicious Behavior:** Analyze logs to identify unauthorized or suspicious activity
- **Threat Hunting:** Quickly search for matches against indicators of compromise, extracted into common data fields
- **Achieving Compliance:** Use [built-in policies](https://github.com/panther-labs/panther-analysis) as controls for achieving SOC/PCI/HIPAA compliance
- **Securing Cloud Resources:** Model security best practices with Python policies and automatically fix misconfigurations with automatic remediation

_NOTE: Panther is currently in beta_

## Deployment

Follow our [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.runpanther.io/quick-start) to deploy Panther to your AWS account in a matter of minutes!

## Why Panther?

It's no longer feasible to find the needle in the security log haystack _manually_. Many security teams have struggled to solve this problem with SIEMs and traditional log analytics platforms due to their high cost, overhead, and scale.

Panther utilizes the elastic nature of serverless cloud services to provide a high-scale, performant, and flexible solution at a much lower cost. Panther also comes built-in with a rich and intuitive user interface, built-in detections, and first-class AWS support.
