This policy validates that AWS IAM account access keys are rotated every 90 days.

Regularly rotating access keys is considered security best practice as it reduces the amount of time a compromised key can be used to access an account.

**Remediation**

To remediate this, each unrotated access key must be deleted, then a new access key created. All programmatic calls making use of the old key should be updated with the new key.

In order to prevent a service outage, it is possible to first move all programmatic calls to a new key and then disable the non-compliant key. The following instructions will be using this method.

| Using the AWS Console                                                                                                                                                            |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Access the User tab of the IAM console at:                                                                                                                                    |
| [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home\#/users](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users)                                                                                |
| 2. Select the name of the non-compliant user.                                                                                                                                    |
| 3. Select the "Security Credentials" tab.                                                                                                                                        |
| 4. Under the "Access Keys" section, select the "Create access key" button.                                                                                                       |
| 5. Securely store the new Secret access key.                                                                                                                                     |
| Note: this key contains sensitive information and should be treated as such.                                                                                                     |
| 6. Update all programatic calls using the old access key to use the new access key, and verify they are working.                                                                 |
| 7. Back at the "Security Credentials" tab, under the "Access Keys" section, select "Make inactive" under the "Status" column for the old key.                                    |
| 8. Verify that all programmatic access is still working as expected.                                                                                                             |
| 9. Back at the "Security Credentials" tab, under the "Access Keys" section, select the gray "x" under the "Status" column for the old key. Select "Delete" in the pop up window. |

| Using the AWS CLI Tool                                                                                           |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. First create a new access key with the following command:                                                     |
| `aws iam create-access-key --user-name <user_name>`                                                              |
| 2. Store the secret key generated by the previous command, which was output as "SecretAccessKey".                |
| Note: this key contains sensitive information and should be treated as such.                                     |
| 3. Update all programatic calls using the old access key to use the new access key, and verify they are working. |
| 4. Disable the old access key with the following command:                                                        |
| `aws iam update-access-key --user-name <user_name> --access-key-id <access_key_id> --status Inactive`            |
| 5. Verify that all programmatic access is still working as expected.                                             |
| 6. Delete the old access key with the following command:                                                         |
| `aws iam delete-access-key --user-name <user_name> --access-key-id <access_key_id>`                              |
